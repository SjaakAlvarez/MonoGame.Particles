# MonoGame.Particles

MonoGame.Particles is a particle system for MonoGame. It can be used as a normal particle
engine but it also supports particles that use a physics system for collisions.

To use the particle engine, a [World](Documentation/World.md)  object has to be created first. The world
object handles all updates and disposal of particle emitters.
